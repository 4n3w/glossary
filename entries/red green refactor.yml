headword: red green refactor
definition: >
  A catchphrase that summarizes the process of developing software using
  a Test-Drive Development approach. First write a test, see it fail (go red),
  write some code to make the test pass (go green), and finally check if there
  are refactors that would improve the quality of the implementation.
