headword: enablement project
definition: >
  When Pivotal consultants work with external clients, a project might be referred to as an enablement 
  project if one of the specific aims of the process is to teach client developers our Agile development 
  process and transform their organization's approach to software development. The opposite of an enablement
  project is an execution or delivery-focused project where the client is primarily concerned with the 
  delivery of specific apps or features.
