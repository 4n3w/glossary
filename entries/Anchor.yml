headword: Anchor
definition: >
  The anchor is an engineering role on development teams. While Pivotal encourages regular rotation of individual contributors 
  across teams, anchors tend to remain on teams for longer periods of time to increase continuity in the team's work. The anchor
  is responsible for facilitating their team's work and maintaining communication loops within the team, from their team to 
  related teams, and from their team to engineering leaders such as Engineering Directors (in CF) or Office Directors (in Labs).
