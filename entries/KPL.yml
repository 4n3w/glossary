headword: KPL
expansion: Key Priorities List
definition: >
  A single spreadsheet-style document where high-level R&D priorities are tracked. Some items are evergreen
  (e.g. "Fires", "Platform Stability", and "Ship the next release") but other initiatives in the list may rise or fall
  depending on customer need. This page should be visible to everyone in Pivotal R&D organization because one of the
  goals of the KPL is to increase transparency around how work is planned and resources allocated.
