  The Customer0 team leverages real customer use-cases of PCF to drive
  validated learning and feedback to R&D, to refine Pivotal products so
  that our customer engagements are faster, repeatable, and more
  successful. They also reduce the “snowflake customer” support burden
  on GSS and PCFS by developing, refining, and standardizing PCF
  deployment and operation strategies and tools for customers.
