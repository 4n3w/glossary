expansion: 
definition: >
 A popular framework for creating web applications using Java. Spring Boot is an evolution of the Spring 
 framework which allows most configurations to be performed in Java code using configuration classes, 
 annotations, and properties. Most people consider this a quality-of-life improvement over the XML 
 configuration used in the "old" version of Spring.
