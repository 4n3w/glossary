definition: >
  Agile is a software development methodology that prioritizes adaptive,
  iterative processes. It places a high value on individual interactions
  and the flexibility to respond when needs or requirements change. The
  Pivotal Labs consulting practice exists in part to teach our flavor of Agile
  development approaches to customers who want to change the way they
  build software.
