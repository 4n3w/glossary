headword: UI
expansion: User Interface
definition: >
  The way a user interacts with a piece of software. UIs can be graphical, as in a web browser or native app, 
  or they can be textual as in a command-line interface. Graphic UIs are one of the major value-adds that PCF
  provides over open source versions of Cloud Foundry.
